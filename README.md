# RPM-Intelligent-Agent
This is the intelligent agent I developed throughout Knowledge-Based AI in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program.
It uses the Pillow library to derive a pattern from the given image matrices to solve for the solution image with the best score.  This score is derived from one of two methodologies: a dark pixel ratio (DPR) or an intersection pixel ratio (IPR).  You can read more about them in this research paper written by the professor Dr. David Joyner [here](http://www.davidjoyner.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JoynerBedwellGrahamLemmonMartinezGoel-ICCC2015-Distribution.pdf).
